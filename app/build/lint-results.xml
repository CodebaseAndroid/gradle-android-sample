Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."

    <issue
        id="HardcodedText"
        severity="Warning"
        message="[I18N] Hardcoded string &quot;Hello World, MainActivity&quot;, should use @string resource"
        category="Internationalization"
        priority="5"
        summary="Looks for hardcoded text attributes which should be converted to resource lookup"
        explanation="Hardcoding text attributes directly in layout files is bad for several reasons:

* When creating configuration variations (for example for landscape or portrait)you have to repeat the actual text (and keep it up to date when making changes)

* The application cannot be translated to other languages by just adding new translations for existing string resources.

In Android Studio and Eclipse there are quickfixes to automatically extract this hardcoded string into a resource lookup."
